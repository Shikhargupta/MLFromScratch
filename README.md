keywords : classification, supervised learning, discriminative model, non-linear, gradient descent.

Opposed to its name, logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. 

### Binary Classification
- [This]() file contains the implementation of a binary class logistic regression algorithm. 
- The algorithm uses binary cross-entropy loss function. The loss function and its gradient implementation can be found [here]().
- Since it is a **non-linear formulation**, there is no closed form solution and descent methods are used to get to the loss function minimizer.
